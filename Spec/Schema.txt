A Step:

1. Has a method 
2. A set of inputs. Name and mapping.
3. A set of outputs. Name and mapping.

The method attribute defines the class that encaplutes the action performed.
If omitted the step label / name is used as method.

Input name specifies the input of the action
input name without mapping implies implicit mapping to available type instances in context with same name.

Outputname specifies the name to be made available in te context.
Output name without mapping implies implicit mapping to the output with same name from the action
The whole output section can be ommited by convention of implicit mapping


An IO Object

1. Has name
2. Has context (Path)
3. Has type.



Input type matching
-------------------

When an input is mapped to output from a step, follwing process is applied:

1. If type match. If yes, NOOP. If not then,
2. Is scattering of provided input produces corrct input? If yes, use scattering, If not then,
3. If the source step used scattering, can we gather the outputs to correct type? If yes, insert gathering, If not then,
4. Is there a known "translator step" that can be inserted? If yes, insert step, If not then,
5. Error/Failure

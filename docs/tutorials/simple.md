# Building a simple workflow

Let's start with something small, something simple!

## Overview 

> A completed version of this workflow is available within the janis repo: [`janis/examples/simple.py`](https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/janis/blob/master/janis/examples/simple.py) 

 We have a _tar_ archive that contains a Java file. In this tutorial we're going to untar the archive, compile the result of the archive and archive the compiled and uncompiled file. The image below (generated by [Rabix Composer]([https://github.com/rabix/composer](https://github.com/rabix/composer))) gives you a good picture of how our workflow will connect.

### You will need

A basic installation of janis is required (see the [Getting Started](/tutorials/gettingstarted) guide for more info). You can install janis by running:
```bash
pip install janis-pipelines
```

## Let's get started!

We've discussed what our workflow will do, let's identify the tools we'll use to build this. All of these unix tools are bundled with the core installation of `janis`.

- [`untar`](https://janis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/unix/tar.html)
- [`cat`](https://janis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/unix/cat.html)
- [`tar`](https://janis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/unix/untar.html)

These tools are linked to their generated documentation on this site. It's highly recommended you become familiar with this documentation website, as it is the easiest way to determine the tool's requirements.

### Setting up
 
Here's a template for our simple workflow

```python
import janis

 # tool and data_type imports go here

class AlignSortedBam(janis.Workflow):
	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__(self, "simpleWorkflowIdentifier")
		# assemble our workflow here
```

### Inputs

We only have one input, a TarFile. We'll use the type TarFile (`janis.unix.data_types.tarfile`). We can use the import statement:

```python
from janis.unix.data_types.tarfile import TarFile
```

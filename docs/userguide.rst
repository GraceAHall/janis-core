Introduction
============

Before writing pipelines, it's useful to have some background knowledge of what makes up a Workflow. Simply put:

    *A workflow is a series of steps that are joined to each other.*

A diagram is great way to get an intuitive understanding of what a workflow is, for example to bake `Chocolate chip cookies <https://www.taste.com.au/recipes/chocolate-chip-cookies-2/1bfaa0e6-13b4-489d-bbd8-1cc5caf1fa32 />`_, we can refer to the following workflow:

.. image:: resources/bakecookie-wf.png

There are 8 steps to baking (and eating) a chocolate chip cookie, each represented by a box. The arrows represent the dependencies between the steps (what must be completed before the step can be started). For example, to beat the butter and the eggs, we must have acquired the ingredients. Or to place the rolled cookie balls onto the tray, we must have lined the 2 baking trays and mixed in the flour and chocolate.

We easily see how dependencies are depicted in a workflow, and given enough resources, some of these tasks could be completed at the same time. For example, we can preheat the oven while we're preparing the cookie dough.

We'll come back to this example a few times over the course of this introduction.

requirements [WORKING]
    - build mulled container for tools with multiple requirements

- scripts [TODO]
    - ensure scripts are being copied across in janis-assistant
    - if script as <configfile> do mapping of tool params to script args
    - if script as provided script (limma_voom.R) do nothing
    - for galaxy inbuilt tools (join1), also ensure scripts etc 

- wrappers [TODO]
    - place all wrappers in folder for user to view 
    - includes inbuilt tools

- regex to glob [TODO]
    galaxy ingest collection expressions -> nextflow 
    path "report_data/multiqc_.+\.txt", emit: outStats
    ->
    path "report_data/multiqc_*.txt", emit: outStats


- goseq.xml error:
    --make_plots '$out.make_plots'
    being interpreted as bool positional rather than option (--prefix value)

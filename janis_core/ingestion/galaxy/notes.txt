Skeleton 
- only data files

Minimal
- only step inputs with non-default values 

Full 
- all cmdline options. 
- how to deal with cheetah for loops? cheetah conditionals? 
- for tool components with multiple possible input params, use aliases, apply the param used as step input

allow toolshed paths for tool ingest

- scripts [TODO]
    - each tool script should be listed in files_to_create
    - each tool script should have name f'{script.name / configfile.name}_script'
    - each tool script should have an associated ToolInput with position etc 
    - each tool script should be supplied from params, and its default should be './templates/script'
    - scripts are file workflow inputs but have a default

    - check galaxy inbuilt tools (join1)
    - set script defaults in nextflow.config
    - def script = script.simpleName != params.NULL ? script : "column_maker.py" NO

requirements [CHECK]
    - build mulled container for tools with multiple requirements

- goseq.xml error:
    --make_plots '$out.make_plots'
    being interpreted as bool positional rather than option (--prefix value)

Skeleton 
- only data files

Minimal
- only step inputs with non-default values 

Full 
- all cmdline options. 
- how to deal with cheetah for loops? cheetah conditionals? 
- for tool components with multiple possible input params, use aliases, apply the param used as step input


TODO
requirements [WORKING]
    - build mulled container for tools with multiple requirements
        - command not working for some reason, but works in cmdline
    - set name as quay.io/biocontainers/janis-translate-limma-voom-3.34.9.9 etc
    - add this container to container cache (ContainerCache.add())

- scripts [WORKING]
    
    - ensure scripts are being copied across in janis-assistant
    - if script as <configfile> do mapping of tool params to script args
    - if script as provided script (limma_voom.R) do nothing
    - for galaxy inbuilt tools (join1), also ensure scripts etc 

- wrappers
    - place all wrappers in folder for user to view 
    - includes inbuilt tools
